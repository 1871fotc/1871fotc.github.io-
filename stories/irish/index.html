<!-- https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19550487?searchTerm=anne%20Devoy -->

<p>Born 1817 at Donadea near Hodgetown Co. Kildare, Devoy was the daughter of James and Honor Reilly. Her mother was the daughter of the Countess de Farnton, who escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and fled to Ireland to take up refuge with her friend, the Earl of Kildare at Castle Kilkea. </p>
<p>Anne married Patrick Devoy and with the union came the “<em>curse of the Devoys</em>”. This had been placed on a Devoy of Huguenot stock who turned in a Catholic priest to Cromwell’s men. As he was taken away, the priest blessed all the Devoy women and cursed the men so that no male Devoy would live to see his son in manhood. </p>
<p>The Devoys arrived in Queensland in 1864 on the <em>Landsborough</em> after selling their land in Ireland to the Ursuline nuns. They brought a young family with them; John (later Managing Director of Castlemaine Perkins), Marguerite and Annie. In the tradition of the curse <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/123149288?searchTerm=Patrick%20Devoy">Pat was killed the same year by a landslide</a> while selecting land near Toowoomba. Anne died in 1908.</p>

<p>The family left Ireland for London and boarded the <em>RMS Dacca</em> heading for Queensland. The trip took a little longer than expected. The ship left London 29<sup>th</sup> April 1890 and the trip was interrupted at 6.30AM on the 16<sup>th</sup> May when she hit the Daedulus Reef in the Red Sea. All passengers were able to climb down onto the rocks of the reef where they all stood in waist deep water until some were moved to the rocks surrounding the lighthouse. According to the <em>London Illustrated News</em>, May 20<sup>th</sup>, The passengers lost everything except the wet clothes they were standing in when the ship sank four hours later. No lives were lost. </p>

<p>Michael Joseph Devitt 1892—1932 buried in the same grave was his son born 11 June 1892 and he was a horse trainer and show rider.

He came down to the Brisbane National show to ride in the men’s event and met a young lady Zora Brenda Pitt who was the ladies champion rider that year. They married in 1917 in Brisbane and raised their family of a boy and a girl at various railway stations as he became the manager of railway refreshment rooms. Babinda, Roma St, Helidon and mainly Bundaberg When royalty visited Bundaberg the only place big enough to host the function was the refreshment rooms. He was well respected. He took ill in 1932 and was brought down to Brisbane and sadly died at the very young age of 39 on 24 March 1932 leaving Zorah to bring up two young children. She took up millinery and many were the fashionable ladies at the Brisbane races wearing her creations.</p>
<p>Their son Francis Pitt Devitt served in WWII and was one of the brave Aussies who found themselves up against Japanese Imperial Marines in Bougainville. All specially chosen for being 6 feet plus tall and not a pair of glasses among them. He survived but was always troubled by what he had to do and is buried in Mt Gravatt in the military section. Their daughter Brenda Pitt Devitt, a top horsewoman, artist and photographer married a jockey who became Qld’s premier jockey 9 times and over 1800 wins and they travelled the world but mainly UK and France where he rode a further 850 winners and was privileged to ride for the Queen.</p>
